- Number of crawls `230`
- Number of visits `17,853,798`
  > Visiting a peer means dialing or connecting to it. Every time the crawler or monitoring process tries to dial or connect to a peer we consider this as _visiting_ it. Regardless of errors that may occur.
- Number of unique peer IDs visited `39,501`
- Number of unique IP addresses found `58,707`

Timestamps are in UTC if not mentioned otherwise.

### Classification

![](./plots-50/peer-classifications.png)

Peer classification:

| Classification | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `offline` | A peer that was never seen online during the measurement period (always offline) but found in the DHT |
| `dangling` | A peer that was seen going offline and online multiple times during the measurement period |
| `oneoff` | A peer that was seen coming online and then going offline **only once** during the measurement period |
| `online` | A peer that was not seen offline at all during the measurement period (always online) |
| `left` | A peer that was online at the beginning of the measurement period, did go offline and didn't come back online |
| `entered` | A peer that was offline at the beginning of the measurement period but appeared within and didn't go offline since then |

### Crawls

#### By Agent Version

![](./plots-50/crawl-properties.png)

> Only the top 10 kubo versions appear in the right graph (due to lack of colors). The `0.8.x` versions do not contain disguised storm peers.

> `storm*` are `go-ipfs/0.8.0/48f94e2` peers that support at least one [storm specific protocol](#storm-specific-protocol).

| `i...` | `s` | t  | i | n |

> `AV` = `Agent Version`
 
- `# Final AV` - The last agent version that was observed in this measurement period
- `# Transitions` - How often did this particular peer change its agent version
- `Distinct AVs` - Distinct agent version that this peer transitioned between (could have had a single AV multiple times) 

### Node classification:

- `offline` - A peer that was never seen online during the measurement period (always offline) but found in the DHT
- `dangling` - A peer that was seen going offline and online multiple times during the measurement period
- `oneoff` - A peer that was seen coming online and then going offline only once during the measurement period multiple times
- `online` - A peer that was not seen offline at all during the measurement period (always online)
- `left` - A peer that was online at the beginning of the measurement period, did go offline and didn't come back online
- `entered` - A peer that was offline at the beginning of the measurement period but appeared within and didn't go offline since then

### IP Resolution Classification:

- `resolved` - The number of peer IDs that could be resolved to at least one IP address (excludes peers that are only reachable by circuit-relays)
- `unresolved` - The number of peer IDs that could not or just were not yet resolved to at least one IP address
- `no public ip` - The number of peer IDs that were found in the DHT but didn't have a public IP address
- `relay` - The number of peer IDs that were only reachable by circuit relays

### Cloud Providers
