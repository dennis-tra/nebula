A libp2p DHT crawler that also monitors the liveness and availability of peers. The crawler connects to the standard [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) bootstrap nodes and then recursively follows all entries in their [k-buckets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) until all peers have been visited. Currently I'm running it for the IPFS and Filecoin networks.

üèÜ _The crawler was awarded a prize in the context of the [DI2F Workshop hackathon](https://research.protocol.ai/blog/2021/decentralising-the-internet-with-ipfs-and-filecoin-di2f-a-report-from-the-trenches/)._ üèÜ

## Project Status

The crawler is successfully visiting and following all reachable nodes in the IPFS and Filecoin networks. However, the project is still very young and thus has its sharp edges here and there. Most importantly, the gathered numbers about the IPFS network are in line with existing data like from the [`wiberlin/ipfs-crawler`](https://github.com/wiberlin/ipfs-crawler). Their crawler also powers a dashboard which can be found [here](https://trudi.weizenbaum-institut.de/ipfs_analysis.html).

## Usage

Nebula is a command line tool and provides the `crawl` sub-command. To simply crawl the IPFS network run:

```shell
nebula crawl --dry-run
```

Usually the crawler will persist its result in a postgres database - the `--dry-run` flag prevents it from doing that. One run takes ~5-10 min depending on your internet connection.

See the command line help page below for configuration options:

## How does it work?

### `crawl`

The `crawl` sub-command starts by connecting to a set of bootstrap nodes and constructing the routing tables (kademlia _k_-buckets)
of the remote peers based on their [`PeerIds`](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/). Then `nebula` builds
random `PeerIds` with a common prefix length (CPL) and asks each remote peer if they know any peers that are
closer to the ones `nebula` just constructed (XOR distance). This will effectively yield a list of all `PeerIds` that a peer has
in its routing table. The process repeats for all found peers until `nebula` does not find any new `PeerIds`.

This process is heavily inspired by the `basic-crawler` in [libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/tree/master/crawler) from @aschmahmann.

Every peer that was visited is persisted in the database. The information includes latency measurements (dial/connect/crawl durations), current set of multi addresses, current agent version and current set of supported protocols. If the peer was dialable `nebula` will
also create a `session` instance that contains the following information:

```go
type Session struct {
  // A unique id that identifies a particular session
  ID int
  // The peer ID in the form of Qm... or 12D3...
  PeerID string
  // When was the peer successfully dialed the first time
  FirstSuccessfulDial time.Time
  // When was the most recent successful dial to the peer above
  LastSuccessfulDial time.Time
  // When should we try to dial the peer again
  NextDialAttempt null.Time
  // When did we notice that this peer is not reachable.
  // This cannot be null because otherwise the unique constraint
  // uq_peer_id_first_failed_dial would not work (nulls are distinct).
  // An unset value corresponds to the timestamp 1970-01-01
  FirstFailedDial time.Time
  // The duration that this peer was online due to multiple subsequent successful dials
  MinDuration null.String
  // The duration from the first successful dial to the point were it was unreachable
  MaxDuration null.String
  // indicates whether this session is finished or not. Equivalent to check for
  // 1970-01-01 in the first_failed_dial field.
  Finished bool
  // How many subsequent successful dials could we track
  SuccessfulDials int
  // When was this session instance updated the last time
  UpdatedAt time.Time
  // When was this session instance created
  CreatedAt time.Time
}
```

At the end of each crawl `nebula` persists general statistics about the crawl like the total duration, dialable peers, encountered errors, agent versions etc...

> **Info:** You can use the `crawl` sub-command with the `--dry-run` option that skips any database operations.

### `monitor`

The `monitor` sub-command polls every 10 seconds all sessions from the database (see above) that are due to be dialed
in the next 10 seconds (based on the `NextDialAttempt` timestamp). It attempts to dial all peers using previously
saved multi-addresses and updates their `session` instances accordingly if they're dialable or not.

The `NextDialAttempt` timestamp is calculated based on the uptime that `nebula` has observed for that given peer.
If the peer is up for a long time `nebula` assumes that it stays up and thus decreases the dial frequency aka. sets
the `NextDialAttempt` timestamp to a time further in the future.

### `ping`

The ping command fetches all peers that were found online of the most recent successful crawl from the database and sends ten ICM pings to each host. The measured latencies are saved in the `latencies` table.

### `resolve`

The resolve sub-command takes goes through all multi addresses in that are present in the database and resolves them to their respective IP-addresses. Behind one multi address can be multiple IP addresses due to the [`dnsaddr` protocol](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr/blob/master/protocols/DNSADDR.md).
It further queries the GeoLite2 database from [Maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home) to extract country information about the IP addresses and saves them alongside the resolved addresses.

### `provide`

**Experimental:** Starts a DHT measurement experiment by providing and requesting random content.

## Install

### Release download

There is no release yet. 

### From source

To compile it yourself run:

```shell
go install github.com/dennis-tra/nebula-crawler/cmd/nebula@latest # Go 1.16 or higher is required (may work with a lower version too)
```

Make sure the `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH variable to access the installed `nebula` executable.

## Development

To develop this project you need Go `> 1.16` and the following tools:

- [`golang-migrate/migrate`](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) to manage the SQL migration `v4.14.1`
- [`volatiletech/sqlboiler`](https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler) to generate Go ORM `v4.6.0`
- `docker` to run a local postgres instance

To install the necessary tools you can run `make tools`. This will use the `go install` command to download and install the tools into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. So make sure you have it in your `$PATH` environment variable.

### Database

You need a running postgres instance to persist and/or read the crawl results. Use the following command to start a local instance of postgres:

```shell
docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_USER=nebula -e POSTGRES_DB=nebula postgres:13
```

> **Info:** You can use the `crawl` sub-command with the `--dry-run` option that skips any database operations.

The default database settings are:

```
Name     = "nebula",
Password = "password",
User     = "nebula",
Host     = "localhost",
Port     = 5432,
```

To apply migrations then run:

```shell
# Up migrations
migrate -database 'postgres://nebula:password@localhost:5432/nebula?sslmode=disable' -path migrations up
# OR
make migrate-up

# Down migrations
migrate -database 'postgres://nebula:password@localhost:5432/nebula?sslmode=disable' -path migrations down
# OR
make migrate-down

# Create new migration
migrate create -ext sql -dir migrations -seq some_migration_name
```

To generate the ORM with SQLBoiler run:

```shell
sqlboiler psql
```

## Deployment

First, you need to build the nebula docker image:

```shell
make docker
# OR
docker build . -t dennis-tra/nebula-crawler:latest
```

The `deploy` subfolder contains a `docker-compose` setup to get up and running quickly. It will start and configure `nebula` (monitoring mode), `postgres`, `prometheus` and `grafana`. The configuration can serve as a starting point to see how things fit together. Then you can start the aforementioned services by changing in the `./deploy` directory and running:

```shell
docker compose up 
```

A few seconds later you should be able to access Grafana at `localhost:3000`. The initial credentials are

```text
USERNAME: admin
PASSWORD: admin
```

There is one preconfigured dashboard in the `General` folder with the name `IPFS Dashboard`. To start a crawl that puts its results in the `docker compose` provisioned postgres database run:

```shell
./deploy/crawl.sh
# OR
docker run \
  --network nebula \
  --name nebula_crawler \
  --hostname nebula_crawler \
  dennis-tra/nebula-crawler:latest \
  nebula --db-host=postgres crawl
```

Currently, I'm running the crawler docker-less on a tiny VPS in a 30m interval. The corresponding crontab configuration is:

```text
*/30 * * * * /some/path/nebula crawl 2> /var/log/nebula/crawl-$(date "+\%w-\%H-\%M")-stderr.log 1> /var/log/nebula/crawl-$(date "+\%w-\%H-\%M")-stdout.log
```

The logs will rotate every 7 days.

--- 

To run the crawler for multiple DHTs the idea is to also start multiple instances of `nebula` with the corresponding configuration. For instance, I'm running the crawler for the IPFS and Filecoin networks. The monitoring commands look like this:

```shell
nebula --prom-port=6667 monitor --workers=1000 # for IPFS
nebula --prom-port=6669 --config filecoin.json monitor --workers=1000 # for Filecoin
```

The `filecoin.json` file contains the following content:

```shell

}
```

This configuration is created upon the first start of nebula in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nebula/config.json` and can be adapted from there. 

The corresponding crawl commands look like:

```shell
nebula crawl --workers=1000 # for IPFS (uses defaults like prom-port 6666)
nebula --config filecoin.json crawl --workers=1000 # for Filecoin (uses configuration prom-port 6668)
```

The `workers` flag configures the amount of concurrent connection/dials. I increased it until I didn't notice any performance improvement anymore.

So this is the prometheus ports configuration:

- `nebula crawl` - `ipfs` - `6666`
- `nebula monitor` - `ipfs` - `6667`
- `nebula crawl` - `filecoin` - `6668`
- `nebula monitor` - `filecoin` - `6669`

Furthermore, `nebula` has a hidden flag called `--pprof-port` if this flag is set it also serves `pprof` at `localhost:given-port` for debugging.
## Analysis

There is a top-level `analysis` folder that contains various scripts to help understand the gathered data. More information can be found in the respective subfolders README file. The following evaluations can be found there

- [`geoip`](./analysis/geoip) - Uses a [Maxmind](https://maxmind.com) database to map IP addresses to country ISO codes and plots the results.
- [`churn`](./analysis/churn) - Uses a `sessions` database dump to construct a CDF of peer session lengths.
- [`mixed`](./analysis/mixed) - Multiple plotting scripts for various metrics of interest. See [wcgcyx/nebula-crawler](https://github.com/wcgcyx/nebula-crawler) for plots as I have just copied the scripts from there.
- More to come...
