A network agnostic DHT crawler and monitor. The crawler connects to [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) bootstrappers and then recursively follows all entries in their [k-buckets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) until all peers have been visited. The crawler supports the following networks:

- [IPFS](https://ipfs.network) - [_Amino DHT_](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-09-amino-refactoring/)
- [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) - [_Consensus Layer_](https://ethereum.org/uz/developers/docs/networking-layer/#consensus-discovery)

## Project Status

The crawler is powering critical [IPFS](https://ipfs.network) [Amino DHT](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-09-amino-refactoring/) [KPIs](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-Performance-Indicator), used for [Weekly IPFS Reports](https://github.com/protocol/network-measurements/tree/master/reports) as well as for many metrics on [`probelab.io`](https://probelab.io).
The `main` branch will contain the latest changes and should not be considered stable. The latest stable release that is production ready is version [2.2.0](https://github.com/dennis-tra/nebula/releases/tag/2.2.0).

## Install

### Precompile Binaries

Head over to the release section and download binaries from the [latest stable release](https://github.com/dennis-tra/nebula/releases).

### From source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dennis-tra/nebula
cd nebula
make build
```

Now you should find the `nebula` executable in the `dist` subfolder.

## Usage

Nebula is a command line tool and provides the `crawl` sub-command.

### Dry-Run

To simply crawl the IPFS Amino DHT network run:

```shell
nebula --dry-run crawl
```

The crawler can store its results as JSON documents or in a postgres database -
the `--dry-run` flag prevents it from doing any of it. Nebula will just print a
summary of the crawl at the end instead. A crawl takes ~5-10 min depending on
your internet connection. You can also specify the network you want to crawl by
appending, e.g., `--network FILECOIN` and limit the number of peers to crawl by
providing the `--limit` flag with the value of, e.g., `1000`. Example:

```shell
nebula --dry-run crawl --network FILECOIN --limit 1000
```

To find out which other network values are supported, you can run:

```shell
nebula networks
```

### JSON Output

To store crawl results as JSON files provide the `--json-out` command line flag like so:

```shell
nebula --json-out ./results/ crawl
```

After the crawl has finished, you will find the JSON files in the `./results/` subdirectory.

When providing only the `--json-out` command line flag you will see that the
`*_neighbors.json` document is empty. This document would contain the full
routing table information of each peer in the network which is quite a bit of
data (~250MB for the Amino DHT as of April '23) and is therefore disabled by
default

### Track Routing Table Information

To populate the document, you'll need to pass the `--neighbors` flag to
the `crawl` subcommand.

```shell
nebula --json-out ./results/ crawl --neighbors
```

The routing table information forms a graph and graph visualization tools often
operate with [adjacency lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list). To convert the `*_neighbors.json` document
to an adjacency list, you can use [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and the following command:

```shell
jq -r '.NeighborIDs[] as $neighbor | [.PeerID, $neighbor] | @csv' ./results/2023-04-16T14:32_neighbors.json > ./results/2023-04-16T14:32_neighbors.csv
```

### Postgres

If you want to store the information in a proper database, you could run `make database` or `make databased` (for running it in the background) to start a local postgres instance and run Nebula like:

```shell
nebula --db-user nebula_test --db-name nebula_test crawl --neighbors
```

At this point, you can also start Nebula's monitoring process, which would periodically probe the discovered peers to track their uptime. Run in another terminal:

```shell
nebula --db-user nebula_test --db-name nebula_test monitor
```

When Nebula is configured to store its results in a postgres database, then it also tracks session information of remote peers. A session is one continuous streak of uptime (see below).

However, this is not implemented for all supported networks. The [ProbeLab](https://probelab.network) team is using the monitoring feature for the IPFS, Celestia, Filecoin, and Avail networks. Most notably, the Ethereum discv4/discv5 monitoring implementation still needs some work.  

---

There are a few more command line flags that are documented when you run`nebula --help` and `nebula crawl --help`:

## How does it work?

### `crawl`

The `crawl` sub-command starts by connecting to a set of bootstrap nodes and constructing the routing tables (kademlia _k_-buckets)
of these peers based on their [`PeerIDs`](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/). Then `nebula` builds
random `PeerIDs` with common prefix lengths (CPL) that fall each peers buckets, and asks each remote peer if they know any peers that are
closer (XOR distance) to the ones `nebula` just constructed. This will effectively yield a list of all `PeerIDs` that a peer has
in its routing table. The process repeats for all found peers until `nebula` does not find any new `PeerIDs`.

If Nebula is configured to store its results in a database, every peer that was visited is written to it. The visit information includes latency measurements (dial/connect/crawl durations), current set of multi addresses, current agent version and current set of supported protocols. If the peer was dialable `nebula` will
also create a `session` instance that contains the following information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    -- A unique id that identifies this particular session
    id                      INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    -- Reference to the remote peer ID. (database internal ID)
    peer_id                 INT           NOT NULL,
    -- Timestamp of the first time we were able to visit that peer.
    first_successful_visit  TIMESTAMPTZ   NOT NULL,
    -- Timestamp of the last time we were able to visit that peer.
    last_successful_visit   TIMESTAMPTZ   NOT NULL,
    -- Timestamp when we should start visiting this peer again.
    next_visit_due_at       TIMESTAMPTZ,
    -- When did we notice that this peer is not reachable.
    first_failed_visit      TIMESTAMPTZ,
    -- When did we first notice that this peer is not reachable anymore.
    last_failed_visit       TIMESTAMPTZ,
    -- When did we last visit this peer. For indexing purposes.
    last_visited_at         TIMESTAMPTZ   NOT NULL,
    -- When was this session instance updated the last time
    updated_at              TIMESTAMPTZ   NOT NULL,
    -- When was this session instance created
    created_at              TIMESTAMPTZ   NOT NULL,
    -- Number of successful visits in this session.
    successful_visits_count INTEGER       NOT NULL,
    -- The number of times this session went from pending to open again.
    recovered_count         INTEGER       NOT NULL,
    -- The state this session is in (open, pending, closed)
    -- open: currently considered online
    -- pending: peer missed a dial and is pending to be closed
    -- closed: peer is considered to be offline and session is complete
    state                   session_state NOT NULL,
    -- Number of failed visits before closing this session.
    failed_visits_count     SMALLINT      NOT NULL,
    -- What's the first error before we close this session.
    finish_reason           net_error,
    -- The uptime time range for this session measured from first- to last_successful_visit to
    uptime                  TSTZRANGE     NOT NULL,

    -- The peer ID should always point to an existing peer in the DB
    CONSTRAINT fk_sessions_peer_id FOREIGN KEY (peer_id) REFERENCES peers (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    PRIMARY KEY (id, state, last_visited_at)

) PARTITION BY LIST (state);
```

At the end of each crawl `nebula` persists general statistics about the crawl like the total duration, dialable peers, encountered errors, agent versions etc...

> [!TIP]
> You can use the `crawl` sub-command with the global `--dry-run` option that skips any database operations.

   Network Specific Configuration:

   --check-exposed  Whether to check if the Kubo API is exposed. Checking also includes crawling the API. (default: false) [$NEBULA_CRAWL_CHECK_EXPOSED]

```

### `monitor`

The `monitor` sub-command polls every 10 seconds all sessions from the database (see above) that are due to be dialed
in the next 10 seconds (based on the `next_visit_due_at` timestamp). It attempts to dial all peers using previously
saved multi-addresses and updates their `session` instances accordingly if they're dialable or not.

The `next_visit_due_at` timestamp is calculated based on the uptime that `nebula` has observed for that given peer.
If the peer is up for a long time `nebula` assumes that it stays up and thus decreases the dial frequency aka. sets
the `next_visit_due_at` timestamp to a time further in the future.

Command line help page:

```text
NAME:
   nebula monitor - Monitors the network by periodically dialing previously crawled peers.

USAGE:
   nebula monitor [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --workers value  How many concurrent workers should dial peers. (default: 1000) [$NEBULA_MONITOR_WORKER_COUNT]
   --help, -h       show help
```

### `resolve`

The resolve sub-command goes through all multi addresses that are present in the database and resolves them to their respective IP-addresses. Behind one multi address can be multiple IP addresses due to, e.g., the [`dnsaddr` protocol](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr/blob/master/protocols/DNSADDR.md).
Further, it queries the GeoLite2 database from [Maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home) to extract country information about the IP addresses and [UdgerDB](https://udger.com/) to detect datacenters. The command saves all information alongside the resolved addresses.

Command line help page:

```text
NAME:
   nebula resolve - Resolves all multi addresses to their IP addresses and geo location information

USAGE:
   nebula resolve [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --udger-db value    Location of the Udger database v3 [$NEBULA_RESOLVE_UDGER_DB]
   --batch-size value  How many database entries should be fetched at each iteration (default: 100) [$NEBULA_RESOLVE_BATCH_SIZE]
   --help, -h          show help (default: false)
```

## Development

To develop this project, you need Go `1.23` and the following tools:

- [`golang-migrate/migrate`](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) to manage the SQL migration `v4.15.2`
- [`volatiletech/sqlboiler`](https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler) to generate Go ORM `v4.14.1`
- `docker` to run a local postgres instance

To install the necessary tools you can run `make tools`. This will use the `go install` command to download and install the tools into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. So make sure you have it in your `$PATH` environment variable.

### Database

You need a running postgres instance to persist and/or read the crawl results. Run `make database` or use the following command to start a local instance of postgres:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_USER=nebula_test -e POSTGRES_DB=nebula_test --name nebula_test_db postgres:14
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use the `crawl` sub-command with the global `--dry-run` option that skips any database operations or store the results as JSON files with the `--json-out` flag.

The default database settings for local development are:

```
Name     = "nebula_test"
Password = "password"
User     = "nebula_test"
Host     = "localhost"
Port     = 5432
```

Migrations are applied automatically when `nebula` starts and successfully establishes a database connection.

To run them manually you can run:

```shell
# Up migrations
make migrate-up

# Down migrations
make migrate-down

# Generate the ORM with SQLBoiler
make models # runs: sqlboiler
# This will update all files in the `pkg/models` directory.
```

```shell
# Create new migration
migrate create -ext sql -dir pkg/db/migrations -seq some_migration_name
```

### Tests

To run the tests you need a running test database instance:

```shell
make database # or make databased (note the d suffix for "daemon") to start the DB in the background
make test
```

## Release Checklist

- [ ] Merge everything into `main`
- [ ] Create a new tag with the new version
- [ ] Push tag to GitHub

This will trigger the [`goreleaser.yml`](./.github/workflows/goreleaser.yml) workflow which pushes creates a new _draft_ release in GitHub.

## Networks

> [!NOTE]
> This section is work-in-progress and doesn't include information about all networks yet.

The following sections document our experience with crawling the different networks.

### Ethereum Execution (disv4)

Under the hood Nebula uses packages from [`go-ethereum`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) to facilitate peer
communication. Mostly, Nebula relies on the [discover package](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/p2p/discover).
However, we made quite a few changes to the implementation that can be found in
our fork of `go-ethereum` [here](https://github.com/probe-lab/go-ethereum/tree/nebula) in the `nebula` branch.

Most notably, the custom changes include:

- export of internal constants, functions, methods and types to customize their behaviour or call them directly
- changes to the response matcher logic. UDP packets won't be forwarded to all matchers. This was required so that
  concurrent requests to the same peer don't lead to unhandled packets

Deployment recommendations:

- CPUs: 4 (better 8)
- Memory > 4 GB
- UDP Read Buffer size >1 MiB (better 4 MiB) via the `--udp-buffer-size=4194304` command line flag or corresponding environment variable `NEBULA_UDP_BUFFER_SIZE`.
  You might need to adjust the maximum buffer size on Linux, so that the flag takes effect:
  ```shell
  sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=8388608 # 8MiB
  ```
- UDP Response timeout of `3s` (default)
- Workers: 3000
