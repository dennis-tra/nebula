# Nebula Crawler

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A libp2p DHT crawler that gathers information about the network. Starting with a set of bootstrap nodes it recursively asks all nodes in the network for their DHT entries. Gathered information contains the agent version distribution or dialable/undialable peer ratio

## Project Status

## How does it work?

## Usage

## Install

### Release download

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/dennis-tra/nebula-crawler/releases) and download the latest archive for
your platform.

### From source

To compile it yourself run:

```shell
go install github.com/dennis-tra/nebula-crawler/cmd/crawler@latest
```

## Development

To develop this project you need Go `> 1.16` and the following tools:

- [`golang-migrate/migrate`](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) to manage the SQL migration `v4.14.1`
- [`volatiletech/sqlboiler`](https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler) to generate Go ORM `v4.6.0`

To install the necessary tools you can run `make tools`. This will use the `go install` command to download and install the tools into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. So make sure you have it in your `$PATH` environment variable. 


### Database

Use the following command to start a local instance of postgres:
```shell
docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_USER=nebula -e POSTGRES_DB=nebula postgres:13
```

To run migrations then run:

```shell
# Up migrations
migrate -database 'postgres://nebula:password@localhost:5432/nebula?sslmode=disable' -path migrations up
# OR
make migrate-up

# Down migrations
migrate -database 'postgres://nebula:password@localhost:5432/nebula?sslmode=disable' -path migrations down
# OR
make migrate-down

# Create new migration
migrate create -ext sql -dir migrations -seq some_migration_name
```

To generate the ORM with SQLBoiler run:

```shell
sqlboiler psql
```
